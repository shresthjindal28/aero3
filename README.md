This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Patient & Audio Features

- Patient creation and lookup are available under `/api/patient`.
  - `POST /api/patient` with `{ name, phone?, address? }` creates and stores a patient.
  - `GET /api/patient?id=PAT-XXXXXX` verifies an existing patient ID.
- Recorded audio can optionally upload to Cloudinary and persist on the patient record via `/api/audio`.
  - Configure the following in `.env.local` to enable uploads:
    - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name`
    - `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_unsigned_preset`
  - If these are not set, audio uploads are skipped and the app continues gracefully.
